# Tenjaz Project

Welcome to the **Tenjaz Project**, a Laravel-based backend system that incorporates role-based pricing for products, user management, and authentication functionalities. This project is designed with a robust repository pattern, clean code principles, and scalability in mind.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
- **Docker**: Installed and running on your system.

---

## Features

### 1. Role-Based Pricing
Users are categorized into three tiers:
- **Normal**: No discount on products.
- **Silver**: 10% discount on product prices.
- **Gold**: 15% discount on product prices.

Prices are dynamically adjusted based on the authenticated user's type.

### 2. API Endpoints
- **Authentication APIs**:
   - Login
   - Logout
- **User Management APIs**:
   - CRUD operations for users
- **Product Management APIs**:
   - CRUD operations for products
   - Fetch product details by slug

### 3. Clean Architecture
- Implements **Repository Design Pattern** for better code organization and reusability.
- Comprehensive inline code comments for clarity.

### 4. Dockerized Setup
- Pre-configured for seamless deployment using Docker.
- Containers for Laravel, MySQL, and Nginx.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/herooiboo/Tenjaz.git tenjaz
cd tenjaz
```

---

### 2. Environment Setup

Create the environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

### 3. Start the Docker Containers

Build and start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will create three containers:
- **App**: PHP 8.3 with Laravel
- **MySQL**: Database server
- **Nginx**: Web server

---

### 4. Install Dependencies

Enter the application container and install dependencies:
```bash
docker-compose exec app composer install
```

---

### 5. Database Setup

#### Run Migrations:
Initialize the database schema:
```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

#### Seed the Database:
Seed the database with initial test data:
```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed
```

---



### 6. API Documentation and Testing

#### Postman Collection:
Import the Postman collection file to explore and test API endpoints. The collection is located at:
```
Postman/collection.json
```

#### Environment Variables:
Create the following variables in Postman:
1. `APP_URL` = `http://localhost:1010/`
2. `APP_VERSION` = `v1`
3. `AUTH_TOKEN` = 

---

## Implementation Overview

### Backend Features

#### 1. Database Design
- **Users Table**:
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `username`, `password`, `avatar`, `type`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **Products Table**:
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `image`, `price`, `slug`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

#### 2. Models and Logic
- **Role-Based Pricing**:
   - Discounts are applied dynamically using a match statement:
     ```php
     match ($user->type) {
         UserTypeEnum::Gold => $price * (1 - 0.2),
         UserTypeEnum::Silver => $price * (1 - 0.1),
         UserTypeEnum::Normal => $price,
     };
     ```

- **Enums for User Roles**:
   - Enum: `UserTypeEnum` handles mapping of roles (`1 = Normal`, `2 = Silver`, `3 = Gold`) and provides utility methods.

#### 3. Authentication
- **Login API**:
   - Validates user credentials and generates tokens.
- **Logout API**:
   - Revokes tokens for the current session.

#### 4. API Endpoints
- Users API: Full CRUD operations for user management.
- Products API:
   - Full CRUD operations.
   - Fetch product by slug.
   - Pricing varies by user role.

## Challenges and Constraints

1. **Initial Idea**:
   - Planned to use a `user_tiers` table for dynamic tier management and discounts.
   - This design allowed admins to manage tiers without modifying code.

2. **Constraint**:
   - Required to use a predefined `type` field in the `users` table instead of a dynamic table.
   - While functional, this approach lacks scalability:
      - Adding new tiers requires modifying enums and application logic.
      - Admins cannot dynamically manage tiers and discounts.

---

## Techniques and Approaches

### 1. Repository Design Pattern
- Separates business logic from data access logic.
- Provides a clean abstraction layer between models and controllers.
- Example: `BaseRepository`, `UserRepository`, `ProductRepository`.

---

### 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Encapsulates data for specific use cases to avoid direct usage of raw model data.
- Improves type safety and readability.
- Examples:
    - `AuthCredentialsDTO` (for authentication input).
    - `AuthenticatedUserDTO` (for authenticated user response).

---

### 3. Enum-Based Role Management
- Uses enums to handle predefined user roles (`Normal`, `Silver`, `Gold`).
- Simplifies role management logic with enum methods.
- Example: `UserTypeEnum` provides:
    - Role-to-string mapping.
    - Discount percentage calculation.
    - Flexible conversions.

---

### 4. Match Statements
- Used for concise conditional logic.
- Example:
    - Calculating discounts based on the userâ€™s role in pricing logic.

---

### 5. Middleware for Route Access Control
- **Custom Middleware**:
    - Example: `RejectAuthenticatedUsers` middleware restricts authenticated users from accessing specific routes.
- **Built-in Middleware**:
    - `auth:sanctum`: Ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes.
    - `guest:sanctum`: Ensures only non-authenticated users can access certain routes.

---

### 6. Response Macros
- Provides consistent API response structures across the application.
- Custom Macros:
    - `SuccessResponseMacro` for successful responses.
    - `ErrorResponseMacro` for error responses.

---

### 7. Service Layer
- Encapsulates business logic into reusable service classes.
- Examples:
    - `LoginService`: Handles user login and token generation.
    - `LogoutService`: Handles token revocation.
    - `ProductPricingService`: Manages pricing adjustments based on user roles.

---

### 8. Custom Exception Handling
- Centralized error handling using a custom exception handler (`CustomExceptionHandler`).
- Separate handlers for:
    - Validation exceptions (`ValidationExceptionHandler`).
    - Generic exceptions (`GenericExceptionHandler`).

---

### 9. Laravel Features
- **Factories**:
    - Used to generate test data for `User` and `Product` models.
    - Example: `UserFactory` and `ProductFactory`.
- **Migrations**:
    - Sets up database schema and relationships.
- **Seeders**:
    - Populates the database with initial or test data.

---

### 10. Storage Management
- Handles file uploads and retrieval.
- **Custom File Management Services**:
    - `ImageUploader`: Manages image uploads and optional WebP conversion.
    - `ImageLoader`: Dynamically serves images from storage.
- **Mockup Image Handling**:
    - Ensures default images exist and are copied to appropriate locations.

---

### 11. RESTful API Design
- **Resource Controllers**:
    - `UserController` and `ProductController` follow RESTful conventions.
- **Custom Routes**:
    - Example: Fetching a product by slug (`/products/s/{slug}`).

---

### 12. API Resource Wrappers
- Formats model data for API responses using Laravel's `JsonResource`.
- Examples:
    - `LoginResource`: Structures authenticated user response.
    - `ProductResource`: Structures product data with pricing logic.

---

### 13. Dockerized Environment
- Simplifies development and deployment with containerized services.
- Containers:
    - PHP-FPM (Laravel application).
    - MySQL (database).
    - Nginx (web server).

---

### 14. Validation Rules
- Centralized validation logic in Form Request classes.
- **Custom Validation Rules**:
    - Example: `ValidateEnumString` ensures valid enum values for fields like `type`.

---

### 15. Database Design Best Practices
- **Field Casting**:
    - Example: `type` field cast as an enum in the `User` model.
    - Example: `is_active` cast as a boolean.
- **Protected Attributes**:
    - Sensitive fields like `password` are hidden from serialization.

---

### 16. Testing and Debugging
- **Postman Collection**:
    - Pre-configured for testing APIs.
    - Includes environment variables (`APP_URL`, `APP_VERSION`).

---

### 17. Scalability Considerations
- Discusses future improvements (e.g., dynamic role management using a `user_tiers` table).
- Identifies rigid areas (e.g., enum-based roles) and proposes scalable solutions.

---
### 18. Service Providers
- **Purpose**: Centralizes the registration of application services, bindings, and macros.
- **Custom Providers**:
    - `ExceptionServiceProvider`:
        - Registers a custom exception handler (`CustomExceptionHandler`) to ensure consistent error handling across the app.
    - `ResponseMacroServiceProvider`:
        - Registers custom response macros (`success` and `error`) to provide a unified response format for API endpoints.
- **Benefits**:
    - Enhances maintainability by centralizing configurations.
    - Allows for easy extension and modification of application behavior.
---
### 19. Versioning
- **Purpose**: Ensures that APIs are backward-compatible and future-proof.
- **Implementation**:
  - All API routes are prefixed with a version identifier (`v1`).
  - All `Request`, `Resource` and `Controllers` even `Services` Are Versioned and wrapped in `v1` Directory
- **Benefits**:
  - Allows introducing breaking changes in new versions while maintaining existing functionality for older clients.
